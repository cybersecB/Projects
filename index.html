         <p class="Paragraph2" >
            <strong>Nobody's born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can't talk, can't walk, certainly can't do algebra.<br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody's good at anything at first.<br>
            There was a time when Einstein couldn't count to 10.<br>
            And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
            Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
            <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
            This. is. learning.<br>
            It's not that you don't get it. <br>
            <em>You just don't get it, yet.</em>
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
            Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>

                <div class="ofi">
                    <p class="Paragraph2">
                    The term 3D is a way that scientists use to describe 
                    the dimensions of an object in our 3D world. You might 
                    wondering, what do you mean by dimensions? No I don't mean
                    dimensions of different worlds and the Multiverse, I mean 
                    the length, width and height (x,y,z) of a 3D object. Here is a 3d cube down below!

                    <p class="Paragraph2">
                        A 4D object is similar to a 3D object but is more complex.
                        A 3D object is defined with the x,y and z coordinates however
                        a 4D object is defined with the x,y,z and w coordinates. As a 
                        matter of fact we can not tell a 4D object because our eyes can not
                        process the complexity of it. Here is a 4D Cube also know as a tessaract.

                    <div class="ofi">
                        <p class="Paragraph2">
                            The Solar System is our home in the Milky way Galaxy. It consists of the Sun, Mecury,
                            Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and the five dwarf planets (Ceres,
                            Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris.) The Sun is our star and it is about <big>864,400</big> 
                            miles. Its Corona (Atmosphere) streches beyond the Earth. It has a magnetic field the protect the
                            Solar system from intersteller shockwaves know as CMBs. It spin on its axis in a 22 day cycle.
                            Because the sun is so big and not solid the equator rotates every 36 days.<br> 
                            <br>
                            Mecury, Venus, Earth and marsare the 4 rocky planets in our solar system. Mercury is the fastest planet in 
                            the solar system and completes 1 orbit every 88 Earth days but completes on rotation every 59 Earth days. 
                            Venus Is the hotest planet in the solar system. With a staggering 900°Fas surface temperature.
                            Earth is know for it diverselife and is our home. Mars is the red rocky planet and is know
                            for its dust storms. About 5 rovers have  visited this planet and have sent intel in what it is like there.<br>
                            <br>
                            Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are the 4 gas giants in our solar system. Jupiter is the biggest planet 
                            in our solar system. It is a staggering <big>89,000</big> miles big. It is also know as a failed star. What 
                            I mean by that is that it is made of the same elements as the sun but is not big enough to be a star. Saturn 
                            the planet with the best rings. It also has 147 moons in orbit right now. Uranus is the 7th planet in the 
                            solar system. It is made of Hydrogen, Helium, Methane and some other elements. Neptune is know for it wild 
                            storms.<br>
                            <br>
                            Ceres Is in the asteroid belt. Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris is in the Kuiper belt.
