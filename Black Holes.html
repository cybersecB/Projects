    <h1>Intro to Black Holes</h1>
    <p>Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in outer space. They're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that even light cannot escape their grasp if it comes within a certain distance, called the event horizon. 
       Black holes come in different sizes. 
    </p> 
    <h1>Types of Black Holes</h1>
    <p>There are four types of black holes: stellar, intermediate, supermassive, and miniature. 
       The most common type of black hole, stellar black holes, are created when massive stars explode. 
       Supermassive black holes are found at the center of most galaxies, including the Milky Way. 
       Intermediate black holes are smaller than supermassive black holes but larger than stellar black holes. 
       Miniature black holes are the smallest types of black holes.
    </p>
    <h1>How Black Holes Form</h1>
    <p>Black holes form when massive stars run out of fuel and collapse. 
       They can also form when two neutron stars collide and merge. 
       Black holes can continue to grow by absorbing mass from their surroundings.
    </p>
    <h1>How are Black Holes Detected?</h1>
    <p>Black holes are invisible, but they can be detected by the radiation they emit as they consume matter. This radiation is called Hawking radiation, and it is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking. 
        Hawking radiation is created when pairs of particles and antiparticles are created near the event horizon of a black hole. One particle falls into the black hole, while the other escapes into space. 
        The escaping particle carries away energy, causing the black hole to lose mass. This process is known as black hole evaporation. 
        Black holes can also be detected by the effect they have on nearby stars and galaxies. As a black hole consumes matter, it emits radiation that can be detected by telescopes. 
        The radiation emitted by a black hole can be used to study its properties, such as its mass, size, and temperature. 
        Black holes are thought to play a key role in the evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole. They are also thought to be the key to understanding the nature of space and time.

    <h1>Black Hole Myths and Misconceptions</h1>
    <p>There are many myths and misconceptions about black holes. Some people believe that black holes are portals to other dimensions or that they can be used for time travel. 
       Others believe that black holes are dangerous and that they will eventually consume the entire universe. 
       While black holes are mysterious and fascinating objects, they are not as dangerous as some people believe. 
       Black holes are not portals to other dimensions, and they cannot be used for time travel. 
       Black holes are also not likely to consume the entire universe. 
       While black holes can grow by absorbing mass from their surroundings, they are not likely to consume the entire universe. 
       Black holes are thought to play a key role in the evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole, but they are not likely to destroy the universe.

    <h1>Black Hole FAQs</h1>
    <h2>What is a black hole?</h2>
    <p>A black hole is an object in space with such strong gravitational attraction that even light cannot escape its grasp if it comes within a certain distance, called the event horizon. 
       Black holes are extremely dense, with a gravitational pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape their grasp.
    </p>
    <h2>How are black holes formed?</h2>
    <p>Black holes are formed when massive stars run out of fuel and collapse. 
       They can also form when two neutron stars collide and merge. 
       Black holes can continue to grow by absorbing mass from their surroundings.
