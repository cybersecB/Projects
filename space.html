    <h1>Topic 1: What is the Solar System</h1>
    <p>The solar system is our home in vast clusters of stars
        in the Milky Way Galaxy which is home to 
        <big>100 to 200 billion</big> stars. In contrast that a lot 
        more than the grains of sand on a beach. Some star
        systems have multiple stars in them. For example 
        Alpha centauri has 3 stars in the which we would 
        talk about in the next topic.Our Solar system has 
        the <big>Sun, 8 planets and 5 Dwarf planets (Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris)</big>.<br><br>

        The <big>Sun</big> is at the heart of our system and is the source
        of all the energy. It's made of 92.1 percent Hydrogen(H<small>2</small>O) 
        and 7.8 percent Helium(H<small>e</small>). It's core is 25 percent of 
        its radius and is 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit).
        It is estimated the the sun is 1.3 million times the size of the Earth.<br><br>

        1. The first planet in the list is <big>Mercury</big>. It's known as the fastest planet because it 
        completes one orbit in an outstanding 88 days and it rotates on its axis once every 59 days.
        On the dark side of Mercury, the temperature can drop to a -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-179 degrees Celsius).
        On the bright side, it can rise to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (427 degrees Celsius). It's core is made of iron and
        nickel and is 85 percent of its radius. Its cores is also shrinking and cooling at an alarming rate.<br><br>

        2. The second planet is <big>Venus</big> which is the hottest planet in the solar system. 
        It's atmosphere is made of 96.5 percent carbon dioxide and 3.5 percent nitrogen. 
        It's surface temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit (482 degrees Celsius). 
        It's core is made of iron and nickel like Mercury. It's also the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon.
        and it's the only planet that rotates clockwise. It's also the only plantet that is almost the same size as the Earth.<br><br>

        3. The third planet is <big>Earth</big> which is the only planet that has life on it. It's atmosphere is made of 78 percent nitrogen, 
        21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases. We have 1 moon that orbits the Earth. We should also keep our planet clean and pollution free. Global warming is 
        threatning polar regions and is also causing animals to die and migrate when they are not supposed to.<br><br>

        4. The forth planet is <big>Mars</big> which is known as the red planet due to the reddish iron oxide which the creates dust on its surface. Rovers have been sent to Mars to study 
        its surface and find out reminants of water and life. Rovers like Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity and Perserverance have been sent to Mars to study its surface. Mars has 2 moons which are Phobos and Deimos.
        Phobos is a bit larger than Deimos, and orbits only 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) above the Martian surface. No known moon orbits closer to its planet. It whips around Mars three times a day, 
        while the more distant Deimos takes about 30 hours for each orbit.<br><br>

        5. The fifth planet is <big>Jupiter</big> which is the largest Gas giant in the solar system. It's atmosphere is made of 89.8 percent hydrogen and 10.2 percent helium. It's also the fastest rotating planet in the solar system. 
        Completing a rotation in 10 hours. It has 83 moons and 4 faint rings. It's Gravity is 2.4 times stronger then the Earth. 
        Ganamede is the largest moon in the solar system and is larger than the planet Mercury. Jupiter is also known for its Great Red Spot which is about 
        3 earths wide. Two probes have been sent to Jupiter which are Galileo and Juno. Juno is currently studying the planet and its atmosphere making an orbit in 53 days. A year on Jupiter is 12 Earth Years long.<br><br>

        6. The sixth planet is <big>Saturn</big> which is known for its beautiful rings. It's atmosphere is made of 96.3 percent hydrogen and 3.25 percent helium. It's also the least dense planet in the solar system. It has 141 moons and 7 rings.
        Titan is Saturn's largest moon and is the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere. It's also the second largest moon in the solar system. Saturn has been visited by 4 probes which are Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and Cassini.
        Saturn is the second largest Gas giant in the solar system. It's Gravity is similar to Earth's at 10 meters per second (10<small>m/s</small>).<br><br>

        7. The seventh planet is <big>Uranus</big> which is the coldest planet in the solar system. A year on Uranus is 84 Earth years long. It's atmosphere is made of 83 percent hydrogen, 15 percent helium, and 2 percent methane. It's also the only planet that rotates on its side at an extreme 98 degree angle. 
        Each season is 21 years long.It has 27 moons and 13 rings. Uranus has been visited by only one probe which is Voyager 2. Uranus is the third largest Gas giant in the solar system. It's Gravity is 8.7 meters per second (8.7<small>m/s</small>).<br><br>

        8. The eighth planet is <big>Neptune</big> which is the windiest planet in the solar system. It's winds can reach up to 5000 miles per hour. Its size is 4 times of the Earth. It's atmosphere is made of 80 percent hydrogen, 19 percent helium, and 1 percent methane. It has 14 moons and 6 rings. 
        Triton is Neptune's largest moon and is the only moon in the solar system that orbits its planet in the opposite direction. It's also the coldest moon in the solar system. Neptune has been visited by only one probe which is Voyager 2. Neptune is the fourth largest Gas giant in the solar system. 
        It's Gravity is 11.15 meters per second (11.15<small>m/s</small>).<br><br>

    <h1>Topic 3: What is the Alpha Centauri System</h1>
        <p>
            A world of three stars 4.31 lightyears away named Alpha Centauri. Yeah I know cool name, but it is an amazing place. 
            The Alpha Centauri system consists of three stars: Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Centauri. 
            Alpha Centauri A and B form a binary star system, while Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star that orbits the binary pair at a much greater distance (about 0.21 light years). 
            Proxima Centauri is the closest known star to the Sun. The system is located in the constellation of Centaurus and is the closest star system to the Solar System.
