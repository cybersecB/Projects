    <h1>Intro to Stars</h1>
    <p>Stars are giant, luminous spheres of plasma. They are held together by gravity and powered by nuclear fusion. 
       Stars emit light and heat, and according to scientists, they are the building blocks of galaxies. Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. 
       A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. </p>
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Stars</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Red Giants</li>
        <li>White Dwarfs</li>
        <li>Blue Giants</li>
        <li>Yellow Dwarfs</li>
        <li>Red Dwarfs</li>
    </ul>  
    <p>Stars are classified by their spectra (the elements that they absorb) and their temperature. There are seven main types of stars. In order of decreasing temperature, O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. 
       O stars are the hottest, while M stars are the coolest. </p>
    <h2>Interesting Facts about Stars</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stars are formed in clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae.</li>
        <li>Stars spend about 90% of their lifetime fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores.</li>
        <li>When stars run out of hydrogen, they begin fusing helium into heavier elements, such as carbon and oxygen.</li>
        <li>The sun is a star, but it is relatively young, at only a few billion years old.</li>
        <li>There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Star Formation</h2>
    <p>Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. 
         Turbulence deep within these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its own gravitational attraction. 
         As the cloud collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a star. 
            Three things, according to scientists, are needed for a star to form: a cloud of gas and dust, a force to cause the cloud to collapse, and a spinning disk to form the star.    
    </p>
    <h2>Star Death</h2>
    <p>Stars die when they run out of the nuclear fuel in their cores. 
       In the case of massive stars, this leads to a supernova. 
       The core of the star collapses under gravity and the outer layers are blown off. 
       The core then condenses into a neutron star or a black hole. 
       The outer layers of the star are expelled and shine brightly for a few weeks or months, sometimes outshining all of the other stars in the galaxy combined.
